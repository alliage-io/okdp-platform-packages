# hive-metastore

OKDP chart of the [Hive Metastore](https://hive.apache.org/): table schemas,
partitions and data locations for Trino, Spark and Hive, over an S3 warehouse
and a SQL database. It **provides** a `hive` connection and **consumes** a
`database-server` and an `s3` connection.

It renders the upstream chart
[`oci://quay.io/okdp/charts/hive-metastore`](https://github.com/okdp/hive-metastore)
1.4.0, vendored under `vendor/` (see `vendor.yaml`), with values computed from
the parameters below (`templates/_values.tpl`).

## Parameters

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `db` | (required) | `database-server` connection hosting the metastore schema. Its credentials Secret (`secretRef`) holds `username` and `password`. |
| `storage` | (required) | `s3` connection of the object store holding the warehouse. |
| `s3SecretRef` | (required) | Secret with `accessKey`/`secretKey`: this metastore's own S3 identity. |
| `warehouseBucket` | `hive` | Bucket used as the warehouse directory. |
| `cpu` | `0.5` | CPU request (vCPU); the limit is twice the request. |
| `memoryGi` | `0.5` | Memory request (GiB); the limit is twice the request. |

Platform values read from `global.okdp`: none beyond what the descriptor needs.
`db` and `storage` must be external connections (`connections.<name>`): the
`database-server` and `s3` contracts have no internal naming convention.

## Provided connection

`<release>` (contract `hive`):

```yaml
thriftUri: thrift://<release>-hive-metastore.<namespace>.svc:9083
```

A consumer in the same namespace references it by the release name
(`<project>-<instance>`, e.g. `demo-hive`), without a connection file.

## Hooks

The upstream schema initialisation Job is a `post-install,post-upgrade` hook
(Argo: PostSync, run on every sync). It is idempotent: it initialises the
schema only when `metastore_db_properties` is missing.

## Changes from the KuboCD package

- The Service is `<release>-hive-metastore` (was `<release>`), the name the
  `hive` contract's internal convention gives consumers.
- The connection published was `kcd-<release>-metastore`; it is now `<release>`.

## Tests

```sh
scripts/vendor-charts.sh packages/services/hive-metastore   # download vendor/ (not committed)
helm dependency build packages/services/hive-metastore
for f in packages/services/hive-metastore/ci/*-values.yaml; do
  helm lint packages/services/hive-metastore -f "$f"
  helm template demo-hive packages/services/hive-metastore -n demo -f "$f" >/dev/null
done
```
